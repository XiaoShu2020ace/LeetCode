Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, 
find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.
Return the sum of the three integers.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

给你一个长度为 n 的整数数组 nums 和 一个目标值 target。请你从 nums 中选出三个整数，使它们的和与 target 最接近。
返回这三个数的和。
假定每组输入只存在恰好一个解。

Example 1:
    Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

Example 2:
    Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).
 

Constraints:
    3 <= nums.length <= 500
    -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
    -104 <= target <= 104
